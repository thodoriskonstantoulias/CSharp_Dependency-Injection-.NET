# CSharp_Dependency-Injection-.NET

This project shows the use of Dependency Injection and how important it is.

The project's UI is a WPF application that just shows data of people, which takes from an ASP.NET Core API and retrieved from various services(here is the use of DI).

Also there are unit tests showing how easy are implemented if there is DI.
